# Line_profile_code

A compact python package that contains all the codes needed to compute 1D line profiles. 
In addition, a code that computes LP for all snapshots at one point of time using optimization methods such as MPI.

Goal: Develop a package that hollistically computes 1D LP. Probably generalize for higher dimension calculations.
